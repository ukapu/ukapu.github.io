Listening to: Sam Cooke - Bring It On Home To Me

I'm back at work on Budgie, the SaaS budgetsheet generator, and things have... *changed* since I was around. Most of the form type things are now being done in Python instead of HTML and Jquery, which means that I'm not quite sure what's going on right now. I guess this means I have to start learning some more Python. 

In other news I'm going to be lending my PS3 to a friend this weekend so he can play The Last Of Us. I got him to come over Monday to try it out and he seemed to like it so I'm going to hook him up. I'm really just interested in having someone I can talk to about it. This means I'll probably write less about it here, so that's probably a reason for optimism.

Anyways, what this means is that I'm going to have to get in some serious gaming sessions before the weekend, probably mostly on FIFA 13. My aversion to multiplayer gaming continues, as I've really only been playing Manager mode since I bought it. Atletico Madrid's quest for a second consecutive league title continues.
