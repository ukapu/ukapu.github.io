Listening to: Gunplay - Mask On

I spent last evening playing The Last of Us and I'm not gonna lie, I almost started tearing up 5 minutes in. It's not flawless - the stealth mechanics are a bit messed up at times - but the writing in particular is superb. It's been my experience that video game writing trails behind other forms of narrative, sometimes by a large margin. There are some technical limitations- generally speaking more control for the writer results in less agency for the player (witness the gripping but barely interactive Heavy Rain) but video game writing is still often sophomoric and cliched for reasons having nothing to do with this. The writing in The Last of Us is not groundbreaking (and it definitely has its fair share of cliches) but it's very polished and, as I mentioned before, plenty moving. Video games have the powerful ability to plant the player directly into the narrative, and subsequently the luxury of an automatic connection between the player and protagonist that movies or books have to work to establish. High-falutin' talk aside, The Last Of Us has been quite fun so far, and I'm excited to play more this weekend.
