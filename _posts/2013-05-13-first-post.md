If you're reading this, that means I've managed to set up my GitHub/Jekyll powered blog. After a painstaking amount of work and clever coding, I've built myself an operational site, complete with fancy little dropdown menus and the like. The effort was immense, but I feel like it was worth it.

That's a lie, actually. I just copied some other dudes blog (thanks, [Eric Jones](http://erjjones.github.io/)) straight into my repository, and then replaced every instance of his name with mine.

The point is that I now have a working blog that doesn't require me to mess around with WordPress or Blogger, and I get to retain ownership of my content. At least, those are the reported benefits of working with Jekyll. So far, even with the benefit of my copy-paste wizardry, I've spent most of my time on Stack Overflow instead of blogging. 

Anyways, the *actual* point is that I am currently muddling through my first day of work at the beautiful StackHaus, where everyone has been quite friendly, and I am very excited to be working at FullStack. Here's to many future blog posts.
