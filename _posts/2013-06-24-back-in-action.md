After a glorious two weeks in Europe, I'm currently back in Vancouver, literally soaking up the weather. It's been typically wet and rainy here, and I forsee a lot of time spent indoors over the next week. Which suits me fine, honestly- I've got plenty of work do to both at my job and in the studio.

At Full Stack, I'm currently cooking up a little Twilio app that will make it easier for people to get into the building. At the moment, if you buzz the front door a call gets made from Twilio to two phones, who can buzz you in. However, if the owners of those phones are not around, you can't get it. The app I'm working on will let people add themselves to the list of phones to be called, and consequently buzz in their guests when they want. 

On the side, I've started recording a bit of music. I'm going to try and work hard on my music for this summer, and hopefully have some material to put out by the time school comes around.
