The latest version of the Stack Haus Buzzer has been put into production, and as soon as that has been finished I find myself with a new project on the horizon. A few of us at the office were talking about how difficult it is to shop online for clothes- specifically how hard it is to get properly-fitting clothes online. Online retailers typically only list the numeric size or S/M/L/XL, and depending on the brand and the item these sizes can vary greatly in their actual fit. As a result, it's quite hard to tell whether a piece will fit well if you aren't trying it on at a brick-and-mortar store. So now I'm working on an app that will, when given your measurements, tell you how well you will fit a particular piece. Of course, this all depends on being able to find that item's measurements online, and this means that I have to learn about web scraping. Web scraping, for those not in the know, is the automated gathering of information from websites. So far I am trying to write a program that scrapes data about measurements from online retailers. So far I have not succeeded.
