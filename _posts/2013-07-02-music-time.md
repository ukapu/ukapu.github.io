Listening to: Death Grips- I've Seen Footage

Let's talk music for a bit. I've been listening to a lot of Wu-Tang lately, namely 36 Chambers, as well as some Chief Keef and Death Grips. I had Exmilitary on repeat when I was in Montreal last year, and while I liked it, I found it almost physically exhausting to listen to for long periods of time. This time around I'm listening to the Money Store, which is relatively more melodic than Exmilitary, putting it somewhere between Krzysztof Penderecki and a trash compactor on the scale of melodic-ness.
