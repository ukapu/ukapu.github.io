Listening to: Death Grips- I've Seen Footage

Let's talk music for a bit. I've been listening to a lot of Wu-Tang lately, namely 36 Chambers, as well as some Chief Keef and Death Grips. I had _Exmilitary_ on repeat when I was in Montreal last year, and while I liked it, I found it almost physically exhausting to listen to for long periods of time. Currently I'm listening to their second album, _The Money Store_, which is more melodic than Exmilitary and has more of an electronic vibe. 

Someone once told me that I have a fondness for aggressive music, which surprised me at first, since I don't feel like I am a particularily angry person. More and more, however, I find I do have a fondness for raw and angry music. _Yeezus_ in particular was an album that I enjoyed, though the lyrical content left me a little uneasy. Not to mention that one of my all-time favorite bands is Death From Above 1979, a band that definitely falls within the realm of "aggressive" music. 

Anyways, that's probably enough reflection for the day. Back to work, where I am getting ready to add some new features to the StackHaus Buzzer app.
