This weekend I attended the second-annual Polyglot Unconference, where I was introduced to new people, new ideas, and a new appreciation for sleep. The (un)conference kicked off at 8:45 on Saturday morning, at which point in time I was mostly conscious and almost recuperated from the previous night. For those of you (all two of my readers) that are unfamiliar with the concept of an *Un*conference, it basically runs like a conference that has had its organizational structure totally flattened. There is little distinction between audience and speaker- all are welcome to offer opinions, and most do. All the sessions are proposed and scheduled the morning of the conference, and anyone can come up and propose a session. Basically it's a bunch of people sitting around arguing and talking about their interests, which is not a bad way to spend a Saturday. Polyglot was lots of fun, but it also made me wish, while scurrying from session to session, that I had a more mobile way to access the internet besides my 17-inch laptop, which has an unplugged battery life of around 90 seconds. This leads me to my next big point which is:

I have officially entered the 21st century by purchasing myself a tablet! More specifically, the ASUS Nexus 7, which comes with glowing recommendations from tech writers across the globe. It's pretty nice. My decision to purchase a tablet stemmed from the lack of decent mobile plans in Montreal, where I spend most of the year. Rather than get a smartphone and pay upwards of 60 dollars a month for data, I got a tablet instead. Wifi-only, yes, but to be honest I spend only about 1.5 hours a day without wifi. This also means that I've kept my clunky Nokia phone around for a little while longer, which doesn't really bother me because I only need it for texting and the occasional phone call.

Expect a work-related update in a bit.
