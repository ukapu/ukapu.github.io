So it's my final day at Full Stack, after a very fun few months. I've enjoyed the motivation that I get from being in the startup environment. Seeing people actually developing and working "in the wild", so to speak, has been cool. It's also been an excellent working environment, with interesting people and a beautiful office. 

On Thursday I'll be off to Montreal, where I will be completing my third year at McGill. I'm looking forward to living by myself once more, though with the school year comes all its attendant stresses. Once on my own I tend to lose some of motivation I have at home, and it's going to take a serious effort to keep it up in Montreal. 

On a less negative note, I'll be heading to my first wedding on Saturday with Emma. One of her cousins is getting hitched, and we'll be in attendance. It's a toonie bar.
