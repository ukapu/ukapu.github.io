I've reached a small but important milestone today. I made my first actual contribution to Contractually in the form of a small help image on the side of the template editor. Baby steps, sure, but it's still pretty satisfying. Turns out my issues with Rails in my VM were caused by Vagrant's shared folders feature- it seems that starting the Rails server from a shared folder location (/vagrant) seriously slows down its performance. So I just copied the /vagrant directory to another location in my VM and started the server from there. I will probably have to do my Git pushes from that location as well- another thing to figure out.

In other, more delicious news, I ate lunch at Meat and Bread, where I was shocked by the efficiency of their lunch assembly. Meat and Bread's decor is similar to other Gastown establishments I've visited, a very deliberate and exact sort of unpretentiousness: sandwiches are served on cutting boards and eaten at long, wooden communal tables, possibly in the hopes of generating an atmosphere of camaderie among the tech entrepreneurs and business execs that patronize Meat and Bread. It seems unlikely to succeed in that matter, but the sandwiches are great.
