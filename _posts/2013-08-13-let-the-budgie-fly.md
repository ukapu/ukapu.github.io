Listening to: Big Sean - Control (HOF) ft. Kendrick Lamar and Jay Electronic

Budgie is pretty much done, and looks ready to ship. There are of course a few tweaks to make (and probably many changes to make once we get feedback) but the main functionality is in place. Thanks to Neil of course- I didn't actually do much wrt the main app, though I will say I put in some work on the copy and layout. Anyways, there are a few things to wrap up with the marketing page but it's otherwise smooth sailing from here on out. 

As I said, I mostly did front-end work on Budgie, so the programming I did wasn't  intense. However, it was the first time I had worked with someone else on a project for a long period of time. One of the things that struck me was how easy things were when all your issues and to-do's were organized in one place (like Github) and easily accessible. It's definitely something I'm going to look into once I'm back at school and working on assignments.
