Listening to: Run The Jewels - 36" Chain

I just got back from a long-weekend trip to Winnipeg, where I visited my relatives living there. We checked out, among other things, the diner in St. Boniface where my dad ate with his friends when he grew up. I had a Fat Boy (burger with chili) and some fries. No ketchup for the fries, salt and vinegar only. Service at the diner (called the Dairi-Wip, referred to by my dad as "the Greek place") is pretty much non-existent, but very efficient. The food was delicious, and though I've already eaten lunch today, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.

Speaking of today's lunch- it was leftovers, part of my ongoing campaign to restrain my financial profligacy. We went to a place on Victoria yesterday, where I had possibly the best banh mi I've ever eaten. I ordered the banh mi as an appetizer, and my main course was a massive platter of pork, shrimp patties, lettuce, pickled carrots and bean sprouts. I took the remnants of the platter to work today and feasted on them happily.
