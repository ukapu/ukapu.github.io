For the last couple of days my mind has been buzzing with ideas, most of them to do with a game that I've been planning to make. One of the projects I had in mind at the beginning of this summer was a rapper RPG. The idea has evolved into something more resembling a rap-game simulator (I'm referring here to the 'rap game' as a synonym for the rap industry) that uses a menu-based system like *Football Manager*. Players would create a character and work their way up through the ranks of the rap industry. There's a lot of features rattling around in my brain right now, but right now I just need to start working on them, or perhaps start working on a smaller, less-ambitious game to get oriented with game design. 

I really have no interest in working in the games industry, but I've always had an interest in creating worlds and tweaking game mechanics. When I was in elementary school I made a vast board game/RPG, which took up about 10 pages of legal paper just for the board alone. There was an inventory system and a combat system, there were quests and classes and monsters, it had everything (except for players, of course).
