Things are looking up here. I've gotten set up for production, after lots and lots of fiddling with [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) as well as [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/). The PostgreSQL issues were the most vexing. My PSQL installation inside my Vagrant VM somehow doesn't include a pg_hba.conf file, which made things a bit frustrating to hack through. Normally I'd just be able to edit a few settings in the pg_hba.conf in order to activate things like trust authorization. But anyways, things got (sort of) done, and I'm just about ready to start working on things for Contractually. 

There was also a delicious lunch at the office. Quick-braised beef stiletto with Chinese broccoli, along with some great bread. Considering I had already brought a lunch to the office today, I ended up being very well fed.
