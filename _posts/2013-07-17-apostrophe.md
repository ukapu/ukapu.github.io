Listening to: Sam Cooke - It's All Right

When I started out making this blog, I really had no idea how to work a Jekyll- generated site, and I basically had to rip off (with permission, of course) someone else's repo. Recently, however, I had to set up a few Jekyll blogs for my coworkers, and through this I've been able to glean an understanding of how Jekyll pieces together its sites. With this knowledge in hand, I've started revamping my own blog. Well, 'gutting' might be a better word. I've tried to remove most extraneous stylistic elements, stripping things down to the elements that I completely understand. I want a site that, if pressed, I could make from scratch even with my minimal web design skills. In any case, I've always been a fan of very simple design, so having this sort of layout appeals to me aesthetically as well.
