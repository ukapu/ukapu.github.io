Well so much for the unique titles for each of my blog posts. My collection of art to put beside the posts is dwindling as well. I may actually have to figure out how to disable images on the post index so I don't have to include one every time I blog. Since I "borrowed" this blog layout from another site, I'm not completely sure how the html and css is laid out. Add that to my relative unfamiliarity with Jekyll, and I end up being barely able to make the most basic changes to my site. 

Not to be negative though: things are going well with Contractually, where my first real contribution was implemented today. Now I switch my focus to other tasks, which require a bit of tinkering with my Vagrant VM. At the moment, I've set to customizing my build of Vim on my Vagrant VM. Because of the performance hit from using shared folders, I am currently doing all of my development work from inside the VM. Which probably removes most of benefits of Vagrant, but who cares- it works. A phrase I think might be my motto at this point: "Who cares- it works".
