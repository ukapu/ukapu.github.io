Last night, Emma and I went to the Tacofino Commissary, the brick-and-mortar version of the Tacofino food truck, which I've always seen around but never managed to visit.
We both shared the nachos, which were delicious (Emma especially liked the addition of feta cheese), and then I got the fish and chicken karaage tacos and Emma got the yam tempura taco. The chicken karaage was delicious, though a bit unwieldy, and the fish was possibly the best fish taco I've ever had. The salsa that came with the fish taco and the nachos was a highlight- very fresh and full of taste. For dessert we ordered the churros, which took a while to arrive (so long, in fact, that we ended up getting them for free) but when they did came accompanied with a very interesting sriracha-banana ice cream. 

All-in-all a pleasant experience, and cheap as well.
