Things are getting a little frustrating with the Stack Haus Buzzer. The function that was supposed to be calling several phones in sequence turns out to have been making the calls simultaneously. So what happens is that only one of the phones on the list gets called, and the others never ring. So now I'm trying a bunch of different things that I really don't feel like describing at the moment, as the mere thought of them makes me frustrated.

Anyhow.
