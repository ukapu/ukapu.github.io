Listening to: Hall and Oates - Sara Smile

So the [Budgie](budgetsheet.co) site is up and running, with a functional form that submits people's info to Sasha so she can possibly get them started with a budgetsheet, as well as determine what sort of needs they are trying to address with Budgie. The form actually turned out to be a bit of an issue, since it was originally supposed to be a pre-made Jotform thing, but that clashed horribly with the styling. So I put together a form that duplicated the request that the Jotform one would normally be making, with the same parameters and the same action url. Only this one had some issues with the JQuery validation that came with the template we were using, so I ended up just replacing it with a different form validation plugin. After that I fixed up the copy, which I think now has a good balance between humour and information. Things are progressing.
