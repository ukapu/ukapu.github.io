Peter Bonde - The Snowball

Peter Bonde is a Danish artist whose work I noticed at the Aarhus Modern Art Museum. The piece I saw was entitled "Hell", and had a abstract blue background, through the middle of which had been wrapped a piece of blue canvas with "hell" emblazed upon it in white. I'm always a sucker for text art (probably my favorite artist of all time is Ed Ruscha) and I totally loved the piece when I first saw it. Unfortunately, I've been unable to track down a picture of it since. Anyways, here's a nice piece from Bonde.
