Well, my grand ambitions of being able to start working on [Contractually](http://contractual.ly) before next week have fallen flat. Setting up the application on my machine has involved quite a bit of fiddling around with Rails as well as PostgreSQL. Fortunately, it's given me the opportunity to get more comfortable with the two. In fact, I've started learning some Ruby just to give me some context (also in case I need to mess with any controllers). Ruby is messing with my brain a little bit- I've mostly had experience in object-oriented languages, so while classes and inheritance are no big deal, closures are throwing me for a loop. 

Finally, though, I've managed to get the Contractually application running on my machine, and I should be able to start actually being productive soon. However, something about Vagrant (I think it's the shared folders) have made things very very slow on my computer. I'll have to fix that soon, as well as a niggling issue with rvm where it doesn't save my default ruby version.
