Listening to: A$AP Ferg - Let It Go

Last night I volunteered at the GrowConf House Parties, checking people in and giving them wristbands, etc. I was at Ontario House at the Portside Bar, which, by my reckoning, was the second-busiest house after Vancouver House at Brooklyn. Things got off to a rocky start, since the wi-fi at the Portside was awful in the entrance. This meant that we couldn't use the Eventbrite Entry Manager app to check people in, and has to rely on writing down people names and checking them in after- which is not a secure way of doing this sort of thing, to say the least. Eventually someone showed up with an iPhone and we were able to use their data connection.

After my shift, I went out and visited the different houses. Jon was there, along with some of his co-workers from Recombo. Vancouver House was lively while still being less crowded than Ontario House, and had the most food out of the houses. I didn't visit for long in the other Houses - I had already spent too much time at the Portside - and I missed out on the Island House in its entirety. But I got a few free drinks out of the night, so I can't complain.
